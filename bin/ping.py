Usage: 
    ping [-c <count>] [-i <interval>] [-W <timeout>] <destination>

Options:
    -c <count>, --count=<count>  [default: 5]
    -i <interval>, --interval=<interval>  [default: 1.0]
        Wait interval seconds between sending each packet. The default is to wait for one second between each packet normally.
    -W <timeout>, --timeout=<timeout>  [default: 2.]
        Time to wait for a response, in seconds. The option affects only timeout in absense of any responses, otherwise ping waits for two RTTs.
    A pure python ping implementation using raw socket.


    Note that ICMP messages can only be sent from processes running as root.

    Bugs are naturally mine. I'd be glad to hear about them. There are
    certainly word - size dependenceies here.

    Revision history
    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
    August 18, 2016
    changes by J. Bain
      - implemented interface for pythonista stash
      
    March 11, 2010
    changes by Samuel Stauffer:
    - replaced time.clock with default_timer which is set to
      time.clock on windows and time.time on other systems.

    May 30, 2007
    little rewrite by Jens Diemer:
     -  change socket asterisk import to a normal import
     -  replace time.time() with time.clock()
     -  delete "return None" (or change to "return" only)
     -  in checksum() rename "str" to "source_string"

    November 22, 1997
    Initial hack. Doesn't do much, but rather than try to guess
    what features I (or others) will want in the future, I've only
    put in what I need now.

    December 16, 1997
    For some reason, the checksum bytes are in the wrong order when
    this is run under Solaris 2.X for SPARC but it works right under
    Linux x86. Since I don't know just what's wrong, I'll swap the
    bytes always and then do an htons().

    December 4, 2000
    Changed the struct.pack() calls to pack the checksum and ID as
    unsigned. My thanks to Jerome Poincheval for the fix.

    Januari 27, 2015
    Changed receive response to not accept ICMP request messages.
    It was possible to receive the very request that was sent.
