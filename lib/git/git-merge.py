    merges <commit> into HEAD, or remote tracking branch if commit not specified.
    <commit> can be a local or remote ref, or an existing commit sha.

    merge will handle unambiguous conflicts between head and other 
    merge head, and will insert conflict markers if conflicts cannot be resolved.  
    note that the strategy used will prefer changes in the local head.  
    for instance, if HEAD deleted a section, while MERGE_HEAD modified the same 
    action, the section will be deleted from the final without indicating a conflict.
      
    be sure to commit any local changes before running merge, as files in working tree (i.e on disk) are changed, and checked in, which will probably overwrite any local uncomitted changes.
    
    note merge will not actually commit anything.  run git commit to commit a successful merge.

    
    --abort will remove the MERGE_HEAD and MERGE_MSG files, and will reset staging area, but wont affect files on disk.  use git reset --hard or git checkout if this is desired.
