The 'man' command
------------------
- If no arguments are given, man wil list all commands in '$BIN_PATH'.
- If the argument "topics" is given, list all non-command topics.
- If one argument is given and a command has this name, man will print the docstring of this command.
- If one argument is given and no command has this name, man will search for files and folders with this name in '$STASH_ROOT/man/' and '$HOME2/stash_extensions/man/'.
man will ignore file-extensions and numbers in brackets when searching for files.
  - If a file with this name has been found, man will check the file extenson.
    - If the extension is '.txt' or unknown, man will print the content of the file.
    - If the extension is '.html', man will open the file in quicklook.
    - If the extension is '.url':
      - If the content of the file starts with 'stash://', man will restart it's search in the path specified in the content of the file, replacing 'stash://' with '$STASH_ROOT/'.
  - If a dir with this name has been found, man will check whether the argument passed contains brackets with a number between. If no number is given, man will assume it to be 1. man will then show the page starting with page_N, where n is the number.
