monkeypatching(4) --- PATCHES
=============================

There are 3 types of Patches (actually 5, but the other two types are only important to developers):
   A "FunctionPatch" modifies a module, importing it if neccessary.
         Regardless of their name, they may also patch other attributes of a module.
         Reloading a module will break any "FunctionPatch"
   A "ModulePatch" adds or overwrites a whole module.
         This can result in missing attributes (in case they are not implemented).
         However, the most patches will try to implement everything documented in the docs.
   A "PatchGroup" consists of other Patches.

To make it easier to find the right patch, most patchnames are following this schema:
   PatchGroups have a uppercase name, for example "STABLE".
   FunctionPatches have a lowercase name constructed this way:
      <modulename>_<functionname>
   module_patches are named like the module.

There are two subtypes of patches:
   "STABLE"-Patches a more-or-less working and should be pretty stable:
   "INSTABLE"-Patches are still in developement, not working or buggy. They often crash.
"ModulePatches" are always seen as stable.


Available PatchGroups
---------------------

ALL: This Group contains all Patches and is generated automatically.
STABLE: All stable patches and all ModulePatches
INSTABLE: All instable Patches. Do not use these unless you know what you are doing!

OS: All patches for the "os"-module.
OS_POPEN: The patches for "os.popen*".
OS_PROCESSING: patches to emulate process-like behavior


Available Patches:
------------------

os_popen: make "os.popen" use StaSh.
os_popen2: make "os.popen2" use StaSh.
os_popen3: make "os.popen3" use StaSh.
os_popen4: make "os.popen4" use StaSh.
os_system: make "os.system" use StaSh.
os_getpid: make "os.getpid" return the current job_id instead of the pid.
os_getppid: like os_getpid, but for the parent-job.
os_kill: make "os.kill" kill the job_id.
popen2: the "popen2"-module.
subprocess: the "subprocess" module.
