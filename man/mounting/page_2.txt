MOUNTING(2) --- WARNINGS
========================

This documentation was written by a non-native english-spreaker and may contain terrible spelling mistakes and/or grammatical bugs. I do not take any responsibility for any braindamage caused by such.

The 'mount' and 'unmount'-commands use monkeypatches.
This may cause bugs.
For more detailed warnings about monkeypatching, see 'monkeypatching(2)'.

Some scripts may not work correctly when used on a mounted FS.

Sometimes FilesystemInterfaces may become useless while in use.
In this case, you may need to restart StaSh.
For example, the FTP-FSI may get a connection-timeout and break, preventing you from executing any commands.
