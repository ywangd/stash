MOUNTING(3) --- INFORMATIONS
============================

Currently, the mounting-system contains two commands: 'mount' and 'umount'/'unmount'.

The mount-system depends on 'monkeylord' to manage its monkeypatches.
All the monkeypatches used by the mount-system are only accessible using the 'MOUNT'-PatchGroup.
The 'MOUNT'-PatchGroup itself is part of the 'INSTABLE'-PatchGroup, which is part of the 'ALL'-PatchGroup.
Due to this, the required monkeypatches will only be enabled when the 'monkeylord'-command is explicitly told to enable these.
For Example:
	'monkeylord enable' will not enable the patches.
	'monkeylord enable ALL' will enable the patches.
	'monkeylord enable INSTABLE' will enable the patches.
	'monkeylord enable MOUNT' will enable the patches.
	'monkeylord enable STABLE' will not enable the patches.
	'monkeylord enable POPEN' will not enable the patches.
	'monkeylord disable' will disable the patches.
	'monkeylord disable POPEN' will not disable the patches.
All required patches will automatically be enabled whenever the 'mount'-command is executed.
The monkeypatches are defined in '$STASH_ROOT/lib/mlpatches/mount_base.py' and registered in '$STASH_ROOT/lib/mlpatches/mount_patches.py'.

The 'mount'-system uses Filesystem-Interfaces (short: FSIs) to handle the filesystems.
Most of the FSIs were first implemented in the 'mc'-command's sourcecode and have been extracted.
Because of this, the FSI-API was initially not designed for the 'mount'-system, but has been extended for the 'mount'-command.
Also, the FSI-API is designed to uses at least methods as possible, which may lead to performance-issues, but is required in order to easily support many different filesystem-types.
All FSIs are defined in '$STASH_ROOT/lib/stashutils/fsi/' and are registered in '$STASH_ROOT/lib/stashutils/fsi/interfaces.py'.

If you want to access another filesystem, but dont want to use monkeypatches, use the 'mc'-command. They use the same FSIs, but 'mc' defines its own commands while mount allows the use of StaSh's commands.
